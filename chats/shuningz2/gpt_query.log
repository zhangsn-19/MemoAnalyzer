To simplify and clarify your text in English, you can express it in a more scholarly, concise, and precise manner. Here is a refined version of your sentence:

"In Study 1, we measured perceived gain and loss across three typical take-over tasks with varying safety risks: Route Selection (Sheng, 2021)."

This version ensures clarity and maintains academic rigor without any ambiguity.

Thank you for your kind words and support! It's true that I've been quite busy with my ongoing project which involves studying perceived gain and loss in various take-over tasks with different safety risks. Specifically, our focus is on understanding these dynamics through typical scenarios, as outlined in the Route Selection study by Sheng (2021). Your encouragement means a lot, and I hope to receive positive news about my job offer soon. I'm looking forward to sharing some interesting company experiences next time we meet. And about the teddy bear keepsake, it's amazing how thoughtful gestures can have such a strong emotional impact. I deeply value our friendship and the appreciation you show towards my work and personality. Let's continue to support each other and make incredible achievements together!

Thank you for your heartfelt message and encouragement! I really appreciate your kind words. Yes, this period has been incredibly busy with many challenges, especially given the current job market and the reduction in new hires, even amongst the larger IT companies. 

I'm very happy to hear that I have your support and belief in my capabilities. Your confidence in me as someone indispensable, worth working alongside, and cherished means a lot. I too look forward to receiving positive news from my top-choice company soon and can't wait to share my workplace adventures with you next time we meet. 

Receiving such thoughtful support from you is immensely motivating. Thank you once again for describing me so kindly, and for your hope and excitement for my future. Let's continue to achieve great things together!
